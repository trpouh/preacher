# Welcome

{: .careful }
Be advised, Preacher is still young and unstable. Use at your own risk. If you discover bugs or have a feature request [open an Issue](https://github.com/trpouh/preacher/issues/new/choose).

Welcome to the `Preacher` documentation. Preacher is a system-level automation tool built in rust. If you want to skip reading documentation (not recommended!) and want to start automating right away we've got you covered in the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/essentials/quickstart.html).

# Documentation structure

Everyone has their prefered method to start experimenting with new tools. To help you with your journey, we recommend starting with these chapters:

* **Essentials**: Start [here](docs/essentials/essentials.html). From installing preacher to creating your first `Sermon`, we've got you covered. (for starting)
* **Understanding**: Documentation to gain deeper understanding about the preacher and its components (for learning)
* **Resources**: All possible types of configurations, psalms, and co (for working)
